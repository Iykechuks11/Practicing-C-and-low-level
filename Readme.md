# Low-level Programming Journey

A chronicle of my practical journey with low-level. This repo contains codes and completed assignments mostly from `Hacking Art of Exploitation` by `Jon Erickson`. Below is a list of the tools I have been exploring

- C
- Assembly language (ARM)
- How to write Makefile
- Cryptography
- Cryptanalysis

## Some projects

- [Pseudo-random number generator](/0x285_function_pointer/0x1_rand_example.c)

## Motivation

- I had taken a course that required a good knowledge of low-level programming.

## Goal

- To complete all the exercises in the book, master the art and solve real problems with the skill.
- Learn RUST.
